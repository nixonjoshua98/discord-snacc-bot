Please do join the support server https://discord.gg/QExQuvE if you are interested in using or adding to the bot!

## Requirements
- MongoDB
- Python 3.7+

## Setup

1. Install dependencies by running ``` $ pip install -r requirements.txt ```
2. Create a file named `config.ini` based upon the `config-example.ini` file.
3. Start the bot with `Run.py`

## Note
- Running the bot using a ```config.ini``` file will run the bot in debug mode. To run the bot in
production mode then you will need to set the environment variables manually (shown in ```run.py```) and
not have a ```config.ini``` file created in the root directory.
- Some commands/features may be locked down depending on who is the owner of the bot and/or server.
